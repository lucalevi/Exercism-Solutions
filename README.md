# Exercism Solutions Repo

## What is Exercism?
[Exercism.org](https://www.exercism.org) is an open-source and not-for-profit platfotm to learn coding in 65+ programming languages.

Exercism has also two Bootcamps:
- [Coding Fundamentals](https://exercism.org/courses/coding-fundamentals)
- [Front-End Fundamentals](https://exercism.org/courses/front-end-fundamentals)

The two bootcamps come with a little cost, but they are greatly affordable.

## What is this repo about?
On Exercism, you solve exercises by uploading a solution. 
In this repo, you will find my solutions to the exercises I have submitted on Exercism. 
So far, I have just submitted to the Python track, but in the future I could solve also challanges in other languages.

## What is this repo for?
You can look at the skills I have developed and check whether I know how to programme in a certain language.
Hopefully, I do can programme in Python, at least ;)
